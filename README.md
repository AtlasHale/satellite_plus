# Satellite+
# A project using satellite imagery in combination with other relative features to predict wildfire risk. The imagery data is curated from the NASA Landsat 8 satellite, a low orbit satellite equipped with 11 different detectors, including red, green, blue, and near infrared sensors, allowing a composite true color image to be created. These images are publicly available on AWS, and are searchable and downloadable through the use of sat-stac and sat-util, two python geospatial libraries. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning architecture which can utilize a Convolutional Neural Network on the image data, and combine this with the results of passing features such as temperature, cloud coverage, etc. to a neural network, in an attempt to improve predictive capabilities compared to only using a CNN.
